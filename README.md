# Fused Lasso 

This package includes a fused lasso implementation in R, based on Tibshirani et al. (2005) “Sparsity and Smoothness via the Fused Lasso.”

This implementation was created as a final project in Stat 771 - Statistical Computing.  The final paper, fused-lasso-explanation.pdf, has a brief explanation of fused lasso and some experiments comparing it to the BM3D algorithm (Dabov et al. 2007) for an image de-noising task.
